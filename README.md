# YAGS on Jupyter notebooks
This is repository that can be used as an example for running GAP (https://www.gap-system.org/) and 
YAGS (http://xamanek.izt.uam.mx/yags/installation.html) on a Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org), using binder (https://mybinder.org). 

This repository was built using code from https://github.com/rvf0068/gap-binder-template and a modified version of YAGS from https://github.com/yags/yags/tree/ismael. When this code is deployed on binder, the file "Dockerfile" is used to setup the enviroment for the jupyer notebook.
